# YT-Playlist-Downloader
Download your entire YouTube playlist in seconds, in your preferred file format. It's as easy as a single command.

Primarily using the `yt-dlp` package, I've simplified the process of bulk downloading videos and songs in your preferred format.

## Installation

* Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and ensure that pip is also installed.
 
**Test that Python and pip got installed:**

Open CMD

*This asks Python to tell us its version*
```bash
python --version
```
*This invokes pip's default behavior when called, which is typically equivalent to a CMD 'help'*
```bash
python -m pip
```

* Install yt_dlp
*This uses Python's pip and installs the 'yt_dlp' package*
```bash
python -m pip install yt_dlp
```

**Test that yt_dlp got installed:**

Open CMD
*Again, this asks yt_dlp, through python, what its version it is*
```bash
python -m yt_dlp --version
```

* Download [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows). *This is used for converting, streaming, editing, filtering, and managing metadata of audio and video files.*

**Test that ffmpeg got installed:**
